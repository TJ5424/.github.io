            <p>Hi, my name is T.J. and I work on a variety of <a href="#pastP">projects</a>. I mostly excel at keeping the flow on projects
                and
                tieing up anything my group isn't good at. I have a certification in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Indesign.
                I
                struggle writing the code itself, but I try to express my idea of what I want to code and help my group
                write
                functions and experiment with the ideas.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Down below are some of the projects that I've worked on so far. I am hoping to improve these projects in
                the
                future when I've had more experience with making stand alone games. I am currently working on a VR
                duelers chess
                game by myself attempting to improve my skills in coding unity. I hope to have this project finished
                within the
                next year.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here is my <a

                if you are interested in my skills and would like to contact me. I am available to call from 10am mst to
                10pm
                mst. If I don't answer, you are free to send a voicemail and I will call you back.</p>

                <h3>Crack Jack</h3>
                <p>CrackJack is a game of blackjack where you donâ€™t know what card you have but the computer and other
                    people
                    do. You play the 2D platformer to collect enough points to match the value of a card you want to add
                    to your
                    hand.</p>

                <h3>Emptiness of an atom</h3>
                <p>We were given a weird topic to work with and make an interactive comic about it. We split up sections
                    of the
                    project into videos, animations, and slide presentations.</p>

                <p>We had to make this 360 interactive video so I put a 360 camera on a drone and took that footage and
                    put it
                    in a VR unity experience.</p>
